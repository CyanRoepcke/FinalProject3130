## Introduction
Population models are used to analyze the rate of growth and decay of species under study. In real-world applications, these models can help determine the safest maximum number for harvest, the impact of invasive species, the behavior of epidemics, the factors that affect endangered species, and so forth.

In our best interest, the objective of this project is to use and examine the [populationGrowthModel](https://github.com/adityadua24/populationGrowthModel) for its system behaviour (i.e., interactions between the various species), as well as identify any strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the model.

The [populationGrowthModel](https://github.com/adityadua24/populationGrowthModel), made by Aditya Dua, is a simulation of three species inhabiting a forest together. The interactions between the species are pre-established, which impacts their population and chance of survival. The project is orginally written in MATLAB, so the model is converted to run in Python for execution.

## Procedure
The following scenarios will be tested with the project model:

* Mushroom < Rabbit < Fox
* Mushroom < Rabbit & Mouse < Fox
* Mushroom < Rabbit < Fox & Owl
* Mushroom < Rabbit < Fox < Hunter

In other words, the population model will have a food chain with at least 3 different species, and a different prey or predator species can be added to the system.

To test the accuracy of this model, ecological data must be collected for the species used in the model.

## Demo It Yourself

To try the model yourself, clone the repository by entering:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyanRoepcke/FinalProject3130
```
Then, run the `populationGrowthModel.m` file on MATLAB.
